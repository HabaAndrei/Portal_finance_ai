## Technologies

I use Python as the programming language, with Flask as the server and Gunicorn in the production environment.
I've developed a RAG model handler, having all data saved from the vector database Chroma.

## Description

I provide investment data and recommendations sourced from two government publications. All recommendations are made to ensure safety.
The model is regulated to prevent providing information about other domains.
