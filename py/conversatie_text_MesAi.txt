decline in the \nvalue of your securities.Y ou may owe a substantial amount of \nmoney even after your securities are sold.The margin account \nagreement generally provides that the securities in your mar -\ngin account may be lent out by the brokerage firm at any time \nwithout notice or compensation to you.3.How much risk should you assume?In a new account agreement, you must specify your overall \ninvestment objective in terms of risk.Categories of risk may \nhave labels such as “income,” “growth,” or “aggressive growth.” \nBe certain that you fully understand the distinctions among \nthese terms, and be certain that the risk level you choose ac -\ncurately reflects your age, experience and investment goals.Be \nsure that the investment products recommended to you reflect \nthe category of risk you have selected.When opening a new account, the brokerage firm may ask \nyou to sign a legally binding contract to use the arbitration \nprocess to settle any future dispute between you and the firm \nor your sales representative.Signing this agreement means that \nyou give up the right to sue your sales representative and firm \nin court.A ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY   |  23How Can I Protect Myself?\n\nAnswer 2: They generally have higher risks than money market funds (discussed on pages 18-19), largely because14 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSthey typically pursue strategies aimed at producing higher \nyields.Unlike money market funds, the SEC’s rules do not restrict bond funds to high-quality or short-term investments.Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically in their risks an d rewards.Some of the risks associated with bond fund s include: \n• Credit Risk—the possibility that companies or other issuers whose bonds are owned by the fund may fail to pay their debts (including the debt owed to holders of their bonds).Credit risk is less of a factor for bond funds that invest in insured bonds or U.S. Treasury Bonds.By contrast, those that invest in the bonds of companies with poor credit ratings generally will be subject to higher risk; \n• Interest Rate Risk—the risk that the market value of the bonds will go down when interest rates go up.Because of this, an investor can lose money in any bond fund, including those that invest only in insured bonds or U.S. Treasury Bonds.Funds that invest in longer-term bonds tend to have higher interest rate  risk; and,\n• Prepayment Risk—the chance that a bond will be paid off early.For example, if interest rates fall, a bond issuer may decide to pay off (or retire) its debt and issue new bonds that pay a lower rate.When this happens, the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds in an investment with as high a return or yield.\n\nAnswer 3: Investors \nshould be aware that the performance of these ETFs over a \nperiod longer than one day will probably differ significantly \nfrom their stated daily performance objectives.These ETFs \noften employ techniques such as engaging in short sales and \nusing swaps, futures contracts and other derivatives that can \nexpose the ETF, and by extension the ETF investors, to a host of risks.As such, these are specialized products that typically are \nnot \nsuitable for buy-and-hold investors.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 21A Word on Active and Passive Investing\nAn active investment strategy relies on the skill of an \ninvestment manager to construct and manage the port -\nfolio of a fund in an effort to provide exposure to certain types of investments or outperform an investment benchmark or index.An actively managed fund has the potential to outperform the market, but its perfor -\nmance is dependent on the skill of the manager.Also, actively managed funds historically have had higher management fees, which can significantly lower invest -\nment returns.The shareholder is paying for more active management of portfolio assets, which often leads to higher turnover costs in the portfolio and potentially negative federal income tax consequences.Passive investing is an investment strategy that is \ndesigned to achieve approximately the same return as a particular market index, before fees.The strategy can be implemented by replication—purchasing 100% of the securities in the same proportion as in the index or benchmark—or by a representative sampling of stocks in the index.Passive investing also typically comes with lower management fees.As discussed above, passively managed mutual funds are typically called index funds.\n\nAnswer 4: Once you’ve saved money for investing, consider carefully all \nyour options and think about what diversification strategy makes \nsense for you.While the SEC cannot recommend any particular \ninvestment product, you should know that a vast array of invest -\nment products exists—including stocks and stock mutual funds, \ncorporate and municipal bonds, bond mutual funds, certificates \nof deposit, money market funds, and U.S. Treasury securities.Diversification can’t guarantee  that your investments won’t \nsuffer if the market drops.But it can improve the chances that \nyou won’t lose money, or that if you do, it won’t be as much as \nif you weren’t diversified.What are the best investments for me?The answer depends on when you will need the money, \nyour goals, and if you will be able to sleep at night if you pur -\nchase a risky investment where you could lose your principal.For instance, if you are saving for retirement, and you have \n35 years before you retire, you may want to consider riskier \ninvestment products, knowing that if you stick to only the “sav -\nings” products or to less risky investment products, your money \nwill grow too slowly—or, given inflation and taxes, you may \nlose the purchasing power of your money.A frequent mistake \npeople make is putting money they will not need for a very \nlong time in investments that pay a low amount of interest.On the other hand, if you are saving for a short-term goal, \nfive years or less, you don’t want to choose risky investments, \nbecause when it’s time to sell, you may have to take a loss.Since \ninvestments often move up and down in value rapidly, you want \nto make sure that you can wait and sell at the best possible time.14  |  SAVING AND INVESTINGWhat are investments all about?\n\nAnswer 5: OPENING A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT\nWhen you open a brokerage account, whether in person or on -\nline, you will typically be asked to sign a new account agreement.Y ou should carefully review all the information in this agreement \nbecause it determines your legal rights regarding your account.Do not sign the new account agreement unless you thor -\noughly understand it and agree with the terms and conditionsA ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY   |  21it imposes on you.Do not rely on statements about your ac -\ncount that are not in this agreement.Ask for a copy of any ac -\ncount documentation prepared for you by your broker.The broker should ask you about your investment goals and \npersonal financial situation, including your income, net worth, \ninvestment experience, and
