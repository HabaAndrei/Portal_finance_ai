Dear Reader
While money doesn’t grow on trees, it can grow when 
you save and invest wisely.Knowing how to secure your financial well-being is one 
of the most important things you’ll ever need in life.Y ou don’t have to be a genius to do it.Y ou just need to know a few basics, form a plan, and be ready to stick to it.No matter how much or little money you have, the important thing is to educate yourself about your opportunities.In this brochure, we’ll cover the basics on saving and investing.At the SEC, we enforce the laws that determine how in-
vestments are offered and sold to you.These laws protect in-vestors, but you need to do your part, too.Part of this brochure tells you how to check out investments and the people that sell them so you do not fall victim to fraud or costly mistakes.No one can guarantee that you’ll make money from 
investments you make.But if you get the facts about sav -
ing and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money.

When your money goes to work, 
it may earn a steady paycheck.Someone pays you to use your 
money for a period of time.When you get your money back, 
you get it back plus “interest.” Or, if you buy stock in a compa -
ny that pays “dividends” to shareholders, the company may pay 
you a portion of its earnings on a regular basis.Y our money can 
make an “income,” just like you.Y ou can make more money 
when you and your money work.You buy something with your money that could in -
crease in value.Y ou become an owner of something that you 
hope increases in value over time.When you need your money 
back, you sell it, hoping someone else will pay you more for it.For 
instance, you buy a piece of land thinking it will increase in value 
as more businesses or people move into your town.Y ou expect to 
sell the land in five, ten, or twenty years when someone will buy 
it from you for a lot more money than you paid.And sometimes, your money can do both at the same time—
earn a steady paycheck and increase in value.

Sav -
ings products include savings accounts, checking accounts, and 
certificates of deposit.Some deposits in these products may be 
insured by the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation or the 
National Credit Union Administration.But there’s a tradeoff 
for security and ready availability.Y our money is paid a low 
wage as it works for you.After paying off credit cards or other high interest debt, 
most smart investors put enough money in a savings product to 
cover an emergency, like sudden unemployment.Some make 
sure they have up to six months of their income in savings so 
that they know it will absolutely be there for them when they 
need it.But how “safe” is a savings account if you leave all of your 
money there for a long time, and the interest it earns doesn’t 
keep up with inflation?What if you save a dollar when it can 
buy a loaf of bread.But years later when you withdraw that 
dollar plus the interest you earned on it, it can only buy half 
a loaf?This is why many people put some of their money in 
savings, but look to investing so they can earn more over long 
periods of time, say three years or longer.Investing
When you “invest,” you have a greater chance of losing your 
money than when you “save.” The money you invest in se -
curities, mutual funds, and other similar investments typically 
is not federally insured.

But you also have the opportunity to 
earn more money.12  |  SAVING AND INVESTINGTHE BASIC TYPES OF PRODUCTS
Savings Investments
Savings accounts Bonds
Certificates of deposit Stocks
Checking accounts Mutual funds
Real estate
Commodities (gold, silver, etc.)What about risk?All investments involve taking on risk.It’s important that you 
go into any investment in stocks, bonds or mutual funds with a 
full understanding that you could lose some or all of your money 
in any one investment.While over the long term the stock market 
has historically provided around 10% annual returns (closer to 6% 
or 7% “real” returns when you subtract for the effects of inflation), 
the long term does sometimes take a rather long, long time to play 
out.Those who invested all of their money in the stock market at 
its peak in 1929 (before the stock market crash) would wait over 
20 years to see the stock market return to the same level.However, those that kept adding money to the market 
throughout that time would have done very well for them -
selves, as the lower cost of stocks in the 1930s made for some 
hefty gains for those who bought and held over the course of 
the next twenty years or more.It is often said that the greater the risk, the greater the po -
tential reward in investing, but taking on unnecessary risk is 
often avoidable.Investors best protect themselves against risk 
by spreading their money among various investments, hop -
ing that if one investment loses money, the other investments 
will more than make up for those losses.This strategy, called

Once you’ve saved money for investing, consider carefully all 
your options and think about what diversification strategy makes 
sense for you.While the SEC cannot recommend any particular 
investment product, you should know that a vast array of invest -
ment products exists—including stocks and stock mutual funds, 
corporate and municipal bonds, bond mutual funds, certificates 
of deposit, money market funds, and U.S. Treasury securities.Diversification can’t guarantee  that your investments won’t 
suffer if the market drops.But it can improve the chances that 
you won’t lose money, or that if you do, it won’t be as much as 
if you weren’t diversified.What are the best investments for me?The answer depends on when you will need the money, 
your goals, and if you will be able to sleep at night if you pur -
chase a risky investment where you could lose your principal.For instance, if you are saving for retirement, and you have 
35 years before you retire, you may want to consider riskier 
investment products, knowing that if you stick to only the “sav -
ings” products or to less risky investment products, your money 
will grow too slowly—or, given inflation and taxes, you may 
lose the purchasing power of your money.A frequent mistake 
people make is putting money they will not need for a very 
long time in investments that pay a low amount of interest.On the other hand, if you are saving for a short-term goal, 
five years or less, you don’t want to choose risky investments, 
because when it’s time to sell, you may have to take a loss.Since 
investments often move up and down in value rapidly, you want 
to make sure that you can wait and sell at the best possible time.14  |  SAVING AND INVESTINGWhat are investments all about?

Stocks and Bonds
Many companies offer investors the opportunity to buy either 
stocks or bonds.The example below shows you how stocks and 
bonds differ.Let’s say you believe that a company that makes automo -
biles may be a good investment.Everyone you know is buying 
one of its cars, and your friends report that the company’s cars 
rarely break down and run well for years.Y ou either have an 
investment professional investigate the company and read as 
much as possible about it, or you do it yourself.After your research, you’re convinced it’s a solid company 
that will sell many more cars in the years ahead.The automobile company offers both stocks and bonds.With the 
bonds, the company agrees to pay you back your initial investment 
in ten years, plus pay you interest twice a year at the rate of 8% a year.If you buy the stock, you take on the risk of potentially los -
ing a portion or all of your initial investment if the company 
does poorly or the stock market drops in value.But you also 
may see the stock increase in value beyond what you could 
earn from the bonds.If you buy the stock, you become an 
“owner” of the company.

If you buy the bonds, you 
will get your money back plus the 8% interest a year.And you 
think the company will be able to honor its promise to you on 
the bonds because it has been in business for many years and 
doesn’t look like it could go bankrupt.The company has a long 
history of making cars and you know that its stock has gone 
up in price by an average of 9% a year, plus it has typically paid 
stockholders a dividend of 3% from its profits each year.A ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY   |  15THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN  
STOCKS AND BONDS
Stocks Bonds
If the company profits or is perceived as 
having strong potential, its stock may go 
up in value and pay dividends.You may 
make more money than from the bonds.The company promises to return money 
plus interest.Risk: The company may do poorly, and 
you’ll lose a portion or all of your invest -
ment.Risk:  If the company goes bankrupt, 
your money may be lost.But if there is 
any money left, you will be paid before 
stockholders.Y ou take your time and make a careful decision.Only time 
will tell if you made the right choice.Y ou’ll keep a close eye on 
the company and keep the stock as long as the company keeps 
selling a quality car that consumers want to drive, and it can 
make an acceptable profit from its sales.WHY SOME INVESTMENTS MAKE MONEY  
AND OTHERS DON’T
Y ou can potentially make money in an investment if: 
•  The company performs better than its competitors.

•  The company makes profits, meaning they make enough 
money to pay you interest for your bond, or maybe divi -
dends on your stock.Y ou can lose money if:
• The company’s competitors are better than it is.•  Consumers don’t want to buy the company’s products or services.16  |  SAVING AND INVESTING•  The company’s officers fail at managing the business well, 
they spend too much money, and their expenses are larger 
than their profits.•  Other investors that you would need to sell to think the company’s 
stock is too expensive given its performance and future outlook.•  The people running the company are dishonest.They use 
your money to buy homes, clothes, and vacations, instead 
of using your money on the business.•  They lie about any aspect of the business: claim past or 
future profits that do not exist, claim it has contracts to sell 
its products when it doesn’t, or make up fake numbers on 
their finances to dupe investors.•  The brokers who sell the company’s stock manipulate the 
price so that it doesn’t reflect the true value of the com -
pany.After they pump up the price, these brokers dump the 
stock, the price falls, and investors lose their money.•  For whatever reason, you have to sell your investment 
when the market is down.

Since it takes work to pick the 
stocks or bonds of the companies that have the best chance to do 
well in the future, many investors choose to invest in mutual funds 
and ETFs.A ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY  |  17What are mutual funds and ETFs?A mutual fund or ETF is a pool of money run by a profes -
sional or group of professionals called the “investment adviser.” 
In a managed fund, after investigating the prospects of many companies, the fund’s investment adviser will pick the stocks or bonds of companies and put them into a fund.Investors can buy shares of the fund, and their shares rise or 
fall in value as the values of the stocks and bonds in the fund rise and fall.Investors may typically pay a fee when they buy or sell their shares in the fund, and those fees in part pay the salaries and expenses of the professionals who manage the fund.Even small fees can and do add up and eat into a significant 
chunk of the returns a fund is likely to produce, so you need to look carefully at how much a fund costs and think about how much it will cost you over the amount of time you plan to own its shares.If two funds are similar in every way except that one charges a higher fee than the other, you’ll make more money by choosing the fund with the lower annual costs.For more information about mutual fund and ETF fees and  
expenses, be sure to read our brochure entitled “Mutual Funds and ETFs—A Guide for Investors”—which you can read online at  
Investor.gov.MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFs  WITHOUT ACTIVE 
MANAGEMENT
One way that investors can obtain for themselves nearly the full returns of the market is to invest in an “index fund.” This is a fund that does not attempt to pick and choose stocks of indi -
vidual companies based upon the research of the fund managers or to try to time the market’s movements.An index fund seeks to equal the returns of a major stock index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, the Wilshire 5000, or the Russell 3000.Through computer programmed buying and selling, an index fund tracks

The fees for index mutual funds and ETFs generally are 
much lower than the fees for managed funds.Historical data shows that index funds have, primarily because 
of their lower fees, enjoyed higher returns than the average man -
aged fund.But, like any investment, index funds involve risk.WATCH “TURNOVER” TO AVOID PAYING EXCESS TAXES
T o maximize your fund returns, or any investment returns, 
know the effect that taxes can have on what actually ends up 
in your pocket.Funds that trade quickly in and out of stocks 
will have what is known as “high turnover.” While selling a 
stock that has moved up in price does lock in a profit for the 
fund, this is a profit for which taxes have to be paid.Turnover 
in a fund creates taxable capital gains, which are paid by the 
fund shareholders.All funds are now mandated by the SEC to 
show both their before- and after-tax returns.The differences 
between what a fund is reportedly earning, and what a fund is 
earning after taxes are paid on the dividends and capital gains, 
can be quite striking.If you plan to hold funds in a taxable 
 account, be sure to check out these historical returns in the 
fund prospectus to see what kind of taxes you might be likely 
to incur.Do I Need an Investment Professional?Are you the type of person who will read as much as possible 
about potential investments and ask questions about them?

But if you’re busy 
with your job, your children, or other responsibilities, or feel 
you don’t know enough about investing on your own, then you 
may need professional investment advice.A ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY   |  19WARNING!Before Y ou Invest Always Check with the SEC and Y our State’s 
Securities Regulator:
Is the investment registered?Have investors complained about the investment in the past?Have the people who own or manage the investment been in trouble in the past?Is the person selling me this investment licensed in my state?Has that person been in trouble with the SEC, my state, or other investors in the past?Investment professionals offer a variety of services at a variety 
of prices.It pays to comparison shop.Y ou can get investment 
advice from most financial institutions that sell investments, 
including brokerages, banks, mutual funds, and insurance com -
panies.Y ou can also hire a broker, an investment adviser, an ac -
countant, a financial planner, or other professional to help you 
make investment decisions.

YOU CAN DO IT!IT’S EASIER THAN YOU THINK.No one is born knowing how to save or to invest.Every suc -
cessful investor starts with the basics—the information in this 
brochure.A few people may stumble into financial security—a wealthy 
relative may die, or a business may take off.But for most peo -
ple, the only way to attain financial security is to save and in -
vest over a long period of time.Time after time, people of even modest means who begin 
the journey reach financial security and all that it promises: 
buying a home, educational opportunities for their children, 
and a comfortable retirement.If they can do it, so can you!

They may charge you a fee for the plan, a percentage 
of your assets that they manage, or receive commissions from 
the companies whose products you buy, or a combination of 
these.Y ou should know exactly what services you are getting 
and how much they will cost.Remember, there is no such thing as a free lunch.Profes -
sional financial advisers do not perform their services as an act 
of charity.If they are working for you, they are getting paid for 
their efforts.Some of their fees are easier to see immediately 
than are others.But, in all cases, you should always feel free to 
ask questions about how and how much your adviser is being 
paid.And if the fee is quoted to you as a percentage, make sure 
that you understand what that translates to in dollars.20  |  SAVING AND INVESTINGIn contrast to investment advisers, brokers make recommen -
dations about specific investments like stocks, bonds, or mutual 
funds.While taking into account your overall financial goals, 
brokers generally do not give you a detailed financial plan.Brokers are generally paid commissions when you buy or sell 
securities through them.

Brokerages vary widely in the quantity and quality of the ser -
vices they provide for customers.Some have large research staffs, 
large national operations, and are prepared to service almost any 
kind of financial transaction you may need.Others are small and 
may specialize in promoting investments in unproven and very 
risky companies.And there’s everything else in between.A discount brokerage  charges lower fees and commissions 
for its services than what you’d pay at a full-service brokerage.But generally you have to research and choose investments by 
yourself.A full- service brokerage  costs more, but the high -
er fees and commissions pay for a broker’s investment advice 
based on that firm’s research.The best way to choose an investment professional is to start 
by asking your friends and colleagues who they recommend.Try to get several recommendations, and then meet with po -
tential advisers face-to-face.Make sure you get along.Make 
sure you understand each other.

OPENING A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT
When you open a brokerage account, whether in person or on -
line, you will typically be asked to sign a new account agreement.Y ou should carefully review all the information in this agreement 
because it determines your legal rights regarding your account.Do not sign the new account agreement unless you thor -
oughly understand it and agree with the terms and conditionsA ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY   |  21it imposes on you.Do not rely on statements about your ac -
count that are not in this agreement.Ask for a copy of any ac -
count documentation prepared for you by your broker.The broker should ask you about your investment goals and 
personal financial situation, including your income, net worth, 
investment experience, and how much risk you are willing to 
take on.Be honest.The broker relies on this information to 
determine which investments will best meet your investment 
goals and tolerance for risk.If a broker tries to sell you an in -
vestment before asking you these questions, that’s a very bad 
sign.It signals that the broker has a greater interest in earning 
a commission than recommending an investment to you that 
meets your needs.

Y ou will have the final say on investment decisions unless you 
give “discretionary authority” to your broker.Discretionary au -
thority allows your broker to invest your money without con -
sulting you about the price, the type of security, the amount, 
and when to buy or sell.Do not give discretionary authority to 
your broker without seriously considering the risks involved 
in turning control over your money to another person.2.How will you pay for your investments?Most investors maintain a “cash” account that requires pay -
ment in full for each security purchase.But if you open a 
“margin” account, you can buy securities by borrowing money 
from your broker for a portion of the purchase price.Be aware 
of the risks involved with buying stocks on margin.Begin -
ning investors generally should not get started with a margin 
account.Make sure you understand how a margin account 
works, and what happens in the worst case scenario before you 
agree to buy on margin.Unlike other loans, like for a car or a

The firm has the authority to 
immediately sell any security in your account, without notice 
to you, to cover any shortfall resulting from a decline in the 
value of your securities.Y ou may owe a substantial amount of 
money even after your securities are sold.The margin account 
agreement generally provides that the securities in your mar -
gin account may be lent out by the brokerage firm at any time 
without notice or compensation to you.3.How much risk should you assume?In a new account agreement, you must specify your overall 
investment objective in terms of risk.Categories of risk may 
have labels such as “income,” “growth,” or “aggressive growth.” 
Be certain that you fully understand the distinctions among 
these terms, and be certain that the risk level you choose ac -
curately reflects your age, experience and investment goals.Be 
sure that the investment products recommended to you reflect 
the category of risk you have selected.When opening a new account, the brokerage firm may ask 
you to sign a legally binding contract to use the arbitration 
process to settle any future dispute between you and the firm 
or your sales representative.Signing this agreement means that 
you give up the right to sue your sales representative and firm 
in court.A ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY   |  23How Can I Protect Myself?

Y ou can never ask a dumb question about your investments 
and the people who help you choose them, especially when 
it comes to how much you will be paying for any investment, 
both in upfront costs and ongoing management fees.Here are some questions you should ask when choosing an 
investment professional or someone to help you:
•  What training and experience do you have?How long 
have you been in business?•  What is your investment philosophy?Do you take a lot of risks 
or are you more concerned about the safety of my money?•  Describe your typical client.Can you provide me with ref -
erences, the names of people who have invested with you 
for a long time?•  How do you get paid?By commission?Based on a per -
centage of assets you manage?Another method?

•  How much will it cost me in total to do business with you?Y our investment professional should understand your invest -
ment goals, whether you’re saving to buy a home, paying for 
your children’s education, or enjoying a comfortable retirement.Y our investment professional should also understand your 
tolerance for risk.That is, how much money can you afford 
to lose if the value of one of your investments declines?An 
investment professional has a duty to make sure that he or 
she only recommends investments that are suitable for you.That is, that the investment makes sense for you based on your24  |  SAVING AND INVESTINGother securities holdings, your financial situation, your means, 
and any other information that your investment professional thinks is important.The best investment professional is one who fully understands your objectives and matches investment recommendations to your goals.Y ou’ll want someone you can understand, because your investment professional should teach you about investing and the investment products.How Should I Monitor My Investments?Investing makes it possible for your money to work for you.

Y ou’ll want to keep a close watch on how your employee, your money, is doing.Some people like to look at the stock quotations every day 
to see how their investments have done.That’s probably too often.Y ou may get too caught up in the ups and downs of the “trading” value of your investment, and sell when its value goes down temporarily—even though the performance of the company is still stellar.Remember, you’re in for the long haul.Some people prefer to see how they’re doing once a year.That’s probably not often enough.What’s best for you will most likely be somewhere in between, based on your goals and your investments.But it’s not enough to simply check an investment’s perfor -
mance.Y ou should compare that performance against an index of similar investments over the same period of time to see if you are getting the proper returns for the amount of risk that you are assuming.Y ou should also compare the fees and commissions that you’re paying to what other investment professionals charge.

confirmation slip from your broker.Make sure each trade wasA ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY  |  25IMPORTANT CONTACTS

What are the things you want to save and invest for?• a home
• a car
• an education
• a comfortable retirement
• your children
• medical or other emergencies
• periods of unemployment
• caring for parents
Make your own list and then think about which goals are the 
most important to you.List your most important goals first.Decide how many years you have to meet each specific goal, 
because when you save or invest you’ll need to find a savings or 
YOUR FINANCIAL GOALS
If you don’t know where you are going, you may end up somewhere you don’t want 
to be.To end up where you want to be, you’ll need a roadmap, a financial plan.What do you want to save or invest for?

Make sure the investment professional and her firm are reg -
istered with the SEC and licensed to do business in your state.And find out from your state’s securities regulator whether the investment professional or her firm have ever been dis -
ciplined, or whether they have any complaints against them.Y ou’ll find contact information for securities regulators in the U.S. by visiting the website of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) at www.nasaa.org or by calling (202) 737-0900.Y ou should also find out as much as you can about any in -
vestments that your investment professional recommends.First, make sure the investments are registered.Keep in mind, 
however, the mere fact that a company has registered and files reports with the SEC doesn’t guarantee that the company will be a good investment.Likewise, the fact that a company hasn’t registered and 
doesn’t file reports with the SEC doesn’t mean the company is a fraud.Still, you may be asking for serious losses if, for in -
stance, you invest in a small, thinly traded company that isn’t widely known solely on the basis of what you may have read online.One simple phone call to your state regulator could prevent you from squandering your money on a scam.Be wary of promises of quick profits, offers to share “inside 
information,” and pressure to invest before you have an oppor-tunity to investigate.These are all warning signs of fraud.

If you have ques -
tions, now is the time to ask.A ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY  |  27•How will the investment make money?•How is this investment consistent with my investment goals?•What must happen for the investment to increase in value?•What are the risks?•Where can I get more information?Finally, it’s always a good idea to write down everything your
investment professional tells you.Accurate notes will come in 
handy if ever there’s a problem.Some investments make money.Others lose money.That’s 
natural, and that’s why you need a diversified portfolio to min-imize your risk.

Sometimes all it takes is a simple phone call to your in -
vestment professional to resolve a problem.Maybe there was an honest mistake that can be corrected.If talking to the in -
vestment professional doesn’t resolve the problem, talk to the firm’s manager, and write a letter to confirm your conversa -
tion.If that doesn’t lead to a resolution, you may have to initi -
ate private legal action.Y ou may need to take action quickly because legal time limits for doing so vary.Y our local bar as-sociation can provide referrals for attorneys who specialize in securities law.At the same time, call or write to us and let us know what 
the problem was.Investor complaints are very important to the SEC.Y ou may think you’re the only one experiencing a prob -
lem, but typically, you’re not alone.Sometimes it takes only one investor’s complaint to trigger an investigation that exposes a bad broker or an illegal scheme.Complaints can be filed online with us by going to www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml.

A mutual fund is an SEC-registered open-end investment 
company that pools money from many investors and invests 
the money in stocks, bonds, short-term money-market instru -
ments, other securities or assets, or some combination of these investments.The combined securities and assets the 
mutual fund owns are known as its portfolio, which is managed 
by an SEC-registered investment adviser.Each mutual fund 
share represents an investor’s proportionate ownership of the 
mutual fund’s portfolio and the income the portfolio generates.Investors in mutual funds buy their shares from, and sell/
redeem their shares to, the mutual funds themselves.Mutual 
fund shares are typically purchased from the fund directly or through investment professionals like brokers.Mutual funds 
are required by law to price their shares each business day and 
they typically do so after the major U.S. exchanges close.This 
price—the per-share value of the mutual fund’s assets minus 
its liabilities—is called the NAV or net asset value.Mutual funds 
must sell and redeem their shares at the NAV that is calculated 
after the investor places a purchase or redemption order.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 5Types of Investment Companies
There are three basic types of investment companies:
Open-end investment companies or open-end  
funds—which sell shares on a continuous basis, 
purchased from, and redeemed by, the fund (or through a broker for the fund);
Closed-end investment companies or closed-end 
funds—which sell a fixed number of shares at one time (in an initial public offering) that later trade on a secondary market; and 
Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)—which make a one-  
time public offering of only a specific, fixed number 
of redeemable securities called units and which will terminate and dissolve on a date that is specified at the time the UIT is created.Mutual funds are open-end funds.ETFs are generally structured as open-end funds, but can also be struc -
tured as UITs.ETFs operate pursuant to SEC exemptive orders.6 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSHow ETFs Work
Like mutual funds, ETFs are SEC-registered investment com -
panies that offer investors a way to pool their money in a fund 
that makes investments in stocks, bonds, other assets or some combination of these investments and, in return, to receive an 
interest in that investment pool.Unlike mutual funds, how -
ever, ETFs do not sell individual shares directly to, or redeem their individual shares directly from, retail investors.Instead, 
ETF shares are traded throughout the day on national stock 
exchanges and at market prices that may or may not be the 
same as the NAV of t he shares.ETF sponsors enter into contractual relationships with one 
or more Authorized Participants—financial institutions which 
are typically large broker-dealers.Typically, only Authorized 
Participants purchase and redeem shares directly from the ETF.In addition, they can do so only in large blocks (e.g., 50,000 
ETF shares) commonly called creation units, and they typically 
“pay” for the creation units in an in-kind exchange with a group 
or basket of securities and other assets that generally mirrors 
the ETF’s portfolio.Once an Authorized Participant receives the block of ETF 
shares, the Authorized Participant may sell the ETF shares in 
the secondary market to investors.

An ETF share is trading at a discount 
when its market price is lower than the value of its underlying holdings.A history of the end-of-day premiums and discounts 
that an ETF experiences—i.e., its NAV per share compared to 
its closing market price per share—can usually be found on 
the website of the ETF or its sponsor.Like a mutual fund, an 
ETF must calculate its NAV at least once every day.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 7A Word about Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs)
ETFs are just one type of investment within a broader 
category of financial products called exchange-trad -
ed products (ETPs).ETPs constitute a diverse class of financial products that seek to provide investors with exposure to financial instruments, financial benchmarks, or investment strategies across a wide range of asset classes.ETP trading occurs on national securities exchanges and other secondary markets, making ETPs widely available to market participants including individual investors.Other types of ETPs include exchange-traded  
commodity funds and exchange-traded notes (ETNs).Exchange-traded commodity funds are structured as trusts or partnerships that physically hold a precious metal or that hold a portfolio of futures or other derivatives contracts on certain commodities or cur -
rencies.ETNs are secured debt obligations of finan -
cial institutions that trade on a securities exchange.ETN payment terms are linked to the performance of a reference index or benchmark, representing the ETN’s investment objective.ETNs are complex, involve many risks for interested investors, and can result in the loss of the entire investment.

It does not address other types of ETPs, such as exchange-traded commodity funds or ETNs.8 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSCommon Features of Mutual Funds and ETFs
Some common features of mutual funds and ETFs are 
described below.Whether any particular feature is an advan -
tage or disadvantage for you will depend on your unique circumstances—always be sure that the investment you are considering has the features that are importa nt to you.■■ Professional Management.Most funds and ETFs are  
managed by investment advisers who are registered with the SEC.■■	Diversification.Spreading investments across a wide range 
of companies or industry sectors can help lower risk if a company or sector fails.Many investors find it less expen -
sive to achieve such diversification through ownership of certain mutual funds or certain ETFs than through owner -
ship of individual stocks or bonds.■■ Low Minimum Investment.Some mutual funds accom -
modate investors who don’t have a lot of money to invest by setting relatively low dollar amounts for the initial purchase, subsequent monthly purchases, or both.Similarly, ETF shares can often be purchased on the market for relatively low dollar amounts.

Mutual fund 
investors can readi ly redeem their shares at the next 
calculated NAV—minus any fees and charges assessed on 
redemption—on any business day.Mutual funds mus t send 
investors payment  for the shares within seven days, but 
many funds provide payment sooner.ETF investors can 
trade their share s on the market at any time the market is 
open at the market  price—minus any fees and charges 
incurred at the time of sale.ETF and mutual fund shares  
traded through a broker are required to settle in two  
business days.■Costs Despite Neg ative Returns.Inve stors in mut ual funds  
must pay sales charges, annual fee s, management fe es and  
other expenses (dis cussed on pages 24–32), regardless of  
how the mutual fund performs.Inv estors may also have to  
pay taxes on any capital gains di stribution they receive.Investors in ETFs must pay brokerage commissions, annual  
fees, management fees and other expenses (discus sed on  
pages 24–32), regardless of how t he ETF performs.ETF  
investors may also have to pay taxes on any capit al gains  
distributions; ho wever, because of the structure of certain  
ETFs that redeem proceeds in kind, taxes on ETF investments 
have historically been lower than those for mutual fund 
investments.It is important to note that the tax e fficiency of 
ETFs is not relevant if an invest or holds the mutual fund or 
ETF investment in a tax-advantaged acco unt, such as  an IRA 
or a 401(k).10 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFS■■ Lack of Control.

■■ Potential Price Uncertainty.With an individual stock or an 
ETF, an investor can obtain real-time (or close to real-time) pricing information with relative ease by checking financial websites or by calling a broker.By contrast, with a mutual fund, the price at which an investor purchases or redeems shares will depend on the fund’s NAV, which the fund might not calculate until many hours after an order has been placed.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 11Factors to Consider
Before Investing in Mutual Funds or ETFs: 
■■	Determine	your	financial	goals	and	risk	tolerance.When 
it comes to investing in mutual funds and ETFs, investors 
have thousands of choices.Before you invest in any mutual fund or ETF, you must decide whether the investment strat -
egy and risks are a good fit for you.You should also consid -
er more generally whether the unique style of investing of the mutual fund’s or ETF’s sponsor is a good fit for you.The first step to successful investing is to figure out your current financial goals and risk tolerance—either on your own or with the help of an investment professional.■■ Beware of risk.All investments carry some level of risk.An investor can lose some or all of the money he or she invests—the principal—because securities held by a fund go up and down in value.

Mutual funds and ETFs have different risks and rewards.Generally, the higher the potential return, the higher the risk of loss.■■ Consider the sponsor’s investing style.Before you invest, 
you may want to research the sponsor of the mutual fund or ETF you are considering.The sponsor’s website is often a good place to begin, and it is helpful to spend some time browsing through the website to get a better understanding of the sponsor’s underlying philosophy on investing.Each12 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSsponsor has its own style of investing that will affect how it 
manages its mutual funds and ETFs.It is helpful to under -
stand each sponsor’s style of investing, so you can better choose the right investment for you.■■ Ask and check.Before you engage an investment profes -
sional or purchase shares of a mutual fund or ETF, make sure you research and verify relevant information to deter -
mine which option is best suited for you.• Investment professionals:  Details on an investment 
professional’s background and qualifications are avail -
able on the SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure 
(IAPD) website ( www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/ ) or on the 
SEC’s website for individual investors, Investor.gov.

• Mutual funds and ETFs:  You can research a mutual fund 
or ETF by reading its prospectus (discussed on pages 37-39) carefully to learn about its investment strategy and the potential risks.You can find the prospectus on the mutual fund’s or ETF’s website or on the SEC’s EDGAR database (www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/mutual -
search.html) and download the documents for free.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 13A Word about Derivatives
Derivatives are financial instruments whose perfor -
mance is derived, at least in part, from the perfor -
mance of an underlying asset, security, or index.Even 
small market movements can dramatically affect their value, sometimes in unpredictable ways.There are many types of derivatives with many 
different uses.A mutual fund’s or ETF’s prospectus will disclose whether and how it may use derivatives.An investor may also want to call a fund and ask how it uses these instruments.Different Types of Mutual Funds and ETFs
Mutual funds and ETFs fall into several main categories.Some are bond funds (also called fixed income funds), and some are stock funds (also called equity funds).There are also funds that invest in a combination of these categories, such as balanced funds and target date funds, and newer types of funds such as alternative funds, smart-beta funds and esoteric ETFs.In addition, there are money market funds, which are a specific type of mu tual fund.

They generally have higher risks than money market funds (discussed on pages 18-19), largely because14 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSthey typically pursue strategies aimed at producing higher 
yields.Unlike money market funds, the SEC’s rules do not restrict bond funds to high-quality or short-term investments.Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically in their risks an d rewards.Some of the risks associated with bond fund s include: 
• Credit Risk—the possibility that companies or other issuers whose bonds are owned by the fund may fail to pay their debts (including the debt owed to holders of their bonds).Credit risk is less of a factor for bond funds that invest in insured bonds or U.S. Treasury Bonds.By contrast, those that invest in the bonds of companies with poor credit ratings generally will be subject to higher risk; 
• Interest Rate Risk—the risk that the market value of the bonds will go down when interest rates go up.Because of this, an investor can lose money in any bond fund, including those that invest only in insured bonds or U.S. Treasury Bonds.Funds that invest in longer-term bonds tend to have higher interest rate  risk; and,
• Prepayment Risk—the chance that a bond will be paid off early.For example, if interest rates fall, a bond issuer may decide to pay off (or retire) its debt and issue new bonds that pay a lower rate.When this happens, the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds in an investment with as high a return or yield.

Although a stock fund’s value can rise and fall quickly 
(and dramatically) over the short term, historically, stocks 
have performed better over the long term than other types of 
investments—including corporate bonds, government bonds, 
and treasury securities.Stock funds can be subject to various investment risks, 
including Market Risk , which poses the greatest potential 
danger for investors in stock funds.Stock prices can fluctuate for a broad range of reasons—such as the overall strength of 
the economy or demand for particular products o r services.■■Balanced Funds
Balanced funds invest in stocks and bonds and sometimes 
money market instruments in an attempt to reduce risk but 
still provide capital appreciation and income.They are also 
known as asset allocation funds and typically hold a relatively 
fixed allocation of the categories of portfolio instruments.But 
the allocation will differ from balanced fund to balanced fund.These funds are designed to reduce risk by diversifying among 
investment categories, but they still share the same risks that 
are associated with the underlying types of i nstruments.■■Target Date Funds
Also called target date retirement funds or lifecycle funds, 
these funds also invest in stocks, bonds, and other invest -
ments.Target date funds are designed to be long-term invest -
ments for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind.The name of the fund often refers to its target retirement date16 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSor target date.

Most target date funds are designed so that the 
fund’s allocation of investments will automatically change over 
time in a way that is intended to become more conservative 
as the target date approaches.That means that funds typically 
shift over time from a mix with a lot of stock investments in the 
beginning to a mix weighted more tow ard bonds.Even if they share the same target date, target date funds 
may have very different investment strategies and risks and 
the timing of their allocation changes may be different.They also may have different investment results and may charge 
different fees.Often a target date fund invests in other funds, 
and fees may be charged by both the target date fund and the 
other funds.In addition, target date funds do not guarantee 
that an investor will have sufficient retirement income at the 
target date, and investors can lose money.Target date funds 
are generally associated with the same risks as the underlying 
investments.■■Alternative Funds 
Alternative funds are funds that invest in alternative invest -
ments such as non-traditional asset classes (e.g., global 
real estate or currencies) and illiquid assets (e.g., private 
debt) and/or employ non-traditional trading strategies (e.g., 
selling short).They are sometimes called “hedge funds for 
the masses” because they are a way to get hedge fund-like 
exposure in a registered fund.These funds generally seek 
to produce positive returns that are not closely correlated to 
traditional investments or benchmarks.Many investors may

The risks associated with these investments 
vary depending on the assets and trading strategies employed.These funds can employ complicated investment strategies, 
and their fees and expenses are commonly higher than tra -
ditionally managed funds.In addition, these types of funds generally have limited performance histories, and it is unclear 
how they will perform in periods of mark et stress.■■Smart-Beta Funds
These funds are index funds (discussed below) with a twist.They compose their index by ranking stock using preset factors 
relating to risk and return, such as growth or value, and not 
simply by market capitalization as most traditional index funds 
do.They aim to achieve better returns than traditional index 
funds, but at a lower cost than active funds.T hese funds  
can be more complicated and have higher expenses than traditional index funds, and the factors are sometimes based 
on hypothetical, backward-looking returns.In  addition,  
these types of funds generally have limited p erformance  
histories, and it is unclear how they will perform in periods  
of market stress.■■Esoteric ETFs
Esoteric or exotic funds are ETFs that focus on niche invest -
ments or narrowly focused strategies.They may be compli -
cated investments and may have higher expenses.In addition, 
these ETFs are often thinly traded, which means they can be 
harder to sell and may have larger bid-ask spreads (discussed 
on page 28-29) than ETFs that aren’t as thin ly traded.

Hedge funds are not mutual funds 
and, as such, are not subject to the numerous regula -
tions that apply to mutual funds for the protection of investors—including regulations requiring that mutual fund shares be redeemable at any time, regulations protecting against conflicts of interest, regulations to assure fairness in the pricing of fund shares, disclosure regulations, regulations limiting the use of leverage, and more.■■Money Market Funds 
Money market funds are a type of mutual fund that has relatively low risks compared to other mutual funds and ETFs (and most other investments).By law, they can invest in only certain high-quality, short-term investments issued by the U.S. Government, U.S. corporations, and state and local govern -
ments.Government and retail money market funds try to keep their NAV at a stable $1.00 per share, but the NAV may fall below $1.00 if the fund’s investments perform poorly.Investor losses have been rare, but they are  possible.• A Government Money Market Fund is a money market 
fund that invests 99.5% or more of its total assets in cash, government securities and/or repurchase agree-ments that are collateralized solely by government securities or cash.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 19• A Retail Money Market Fund  is a money market fund 
that has policies and procedures reasonably designed 
to limit all beneficial owners of the money market fund to natural persons.Other money market funds, however, have a floating NAV like other mutual funds that fluctuates along with changes in the market-based value of their portfolio s ecurities.All money market funds pay dividends that generally 
reflect short-term interest rates, and historically the returns for money market funds have been lower than for either bond or stock funds.A risk commonly associated with money mar -
ket funds is Inflation Risk , which is the risk that inflation will 
outpace and erode investment returns  over time.Different Types of Investment Strategies 
■■Index-based Funds 
Index-based mutual funds and ETFs seek to track an under -
lying securities index and achieve returns that closely corre -
spond to the returns of that index with low fees.

Some index funds may also use derivatives (such as options or futures) to help achieve their investment objec -
tive.Index-based funds with seemingly similar benchmarks can actually be quite different and can deliver very different returns.For example, some index funds invest in all of the companies included in an index; other index funds invest in a representative sample of the companies included in an index.Because an index fund tracks the securities on a particular index, it may have less flexibility than a non-index fund to react to price declines in the securities contained in the index.Also20 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSbecause market indexes themselves have no expenses, even a 
passively managed index fund can underperform its index due 
to fees and taxes.■■Actively Managed Funds
The adviser of an actively managed mutual fund or ETF may buy or sell components in the portfolio on a daily basis without 
regard to conformity with an index, provided that the trades 
are consistent with the overall investment objective of the 
fund.Unlike similar mutual funds, actively managed ETFs are 
required to publish their holdings daily.Because there is no 
underlying index that can serve as a point of reference for 
investors and other market participants as to the ETF’s hold -
ings, disclosing the specific fund holdings ensures that market participants have sufficient information to engage in activity, 
called arbitrage, that works to keep the market price of ETF shares closely linked to the ETF’s underly ing value.■■Leveraged, inverse and inverse leveraged ETFs 
Leveraged, inverse, and inverse leveraged ETFs seek to achieve 
a daily return that is a multiple or inverse multiple of the daily 
return of a securities index.These ETFs are a subset of index-
based ETFs because they track a securities index.

Investors 
should be aware that the performance of these ETFs over a 
period longer than one day will probably differ significantly 
from their stated daily performance objectives.These ETFs 
often employ techniques such as engaging in short sales and 
using swaps, futures contracts and other derivatives that can 
expose the ETF, and by extension the ETF investors, to a host of risks.As such, these are specialized products that typically are 
not 
suitable for buy-and-hold investors.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 21A Word on Active and Passive Investing
An active investment strategy relies on the skill of an 
investment manager to construct and manage the port -
folio of a fund in an effort to provide exposure to certain types of investments or outperform an investment benchmark or index.An actively managed fund has the potential to outperform the market, but its perfor -
mance is dependent on the skill of the manager.Also, actively managed funds historically have had higher management fees, which can significantly lower invest -
ment returns.The shareholder is paying for more active management of portfolio assets, which often leads to higher turnover costs in the portfolio and potentially negative federal income tax consequences.Passive investing is an investment strategy that is 
designed to achieve approximately the same return as a particular market index, before fees.The strategy can be implemented by replication—purchasing 100% of the securities in the same proportion as in the index or benchmark—or by a representative sampling of stocks in the index.Passive investing also typically comes with lower management fees.As discussed above, passively managed mutual funds are typically called index funds.

Passively managed ETFs typically have lower costs for  
the same reasons index mutual funds do.In addition, index-based ETFs’ costs and taxes can be even lower  
than index mutual funds’ because of the manner in  
which ETFs operate.22 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSHow Mutual Funds and ETFs Can  
Provide Returns to Investors 
Investors can make money from their investments in 
three ways: 
1.  Dividend Payments —Depending on the underlying secu -
rities, a mutual fund or ETF may earn income in the form of dividends on the securities in its portfolio.The mutual fund or ETF then pays its shareholders nearly all of the income (minus disclosed expenses) it has earned.2.Capital Gains Distributions —The price of the securities a 
mutual fund or ETF owns may increase.When a mutual fund or ETF sells a security that has increased in price, the mutual fund or ETF has a capital gain.At the end of the year, most mutual funds and ETFs distribute these capital gains (minus any capital losses) to shareholders.ETFs seek to minimize these capital gains by making in-kind exchanges to redeeming Authorized Participants instead of selling portfolio s ecurities.3.Increased NAV/Increased Market Price —If the market 
value of a mutual fund’s portfolio increases, after deduction of expenses and liabilities, then the net asset value of the mutual fund and its shares increases.

With respect to dividend payments and capital gains 
distributions, mutual funds usually will give investors a choice:  the mutual fund can send the investor a check or other form of payment, or the investor can have the dividends orU.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 23A Word about  
Exchange-Traded Managed Funds (ETMF)
An exchange-traded managed fund (ETMF) is a 
new kind of registered investment company that is a hybrid between traditional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.Like ETFs, ETMFs list and trade on a national exchange, directly issue and redeem shares only in creation units, and primarily use in-kind transfers of the basket of portfolio secu-rities in issuing and redeeming creation units.Like mutual funds, ETMFs are bought and sold at prices linked to NAV and disclose their portfolio holdings quarterly with a 60-day delay.This structure may allow the product to provide certain cost and tax efficiencies of ETFs while maintaining the confidenti -
ality of the current holdings similar to mutual funds.By not having to disclose their holdings on a daily basis as ETFs do, ETMFs may have an advantage in trying to outperform their benchmarks over time because they are less susceptible to front running by other investors who would be able to trade on the holdings’ disclosures.distributions reinvested in the mutual fund to buy more shares (often without paying an additional sales load).If an ETF inve
s-
tor wants to reinvest a dividend payment or capital gains distri -
bution, the process can be more complicated and the investor may have to pay additional brokerage commissions.Investors should check with their ETF or investment pr ofessional.24 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSThings That Could Reduce  
Mutual Funds’ and ETFs’ Returns 
Investors should consider the effect that fees, expenses, and 
taxes will have on their returns over time.They can signifi -
cantly reduce the returns on mutual funds and ETFs.

Funds pass along these costs to investors by imposing fees and expenses.Shareholder fees are fees charged directly to mutual fund investors in connection with transactions such as buying, sell -
ing, or exchanging shares, or on a periodic basis with respect to account fees.An investor can find these fees and charges listed in the “Fee Table” section of a mutual fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus under the heading, “Shareholder Fees.” ETFs don’t charge these fees directly to investors, but they may have several types of transaction fees and costs, which are descri bed below.Operating expenses are ongoing mutual fund and ETF costs such as investment advisory fees for managing the fund’s holdings, marketing and distribution expenses, as well as cus -
todial, transfer agency, legal, and accountant’s fees.Operating expenses are regular and recurring fund-wide expenses that are typically paid out of fund assets, which means that inves -
tors indirectly pay these costs.These expenses are identified inU.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 25the “Fee Table” section of a mutual fund’s or ETF’s prospectus 
or summary prospectus under the heading, “Annual Fund 
Operating Expenses.” Although these fees and expenses may 
not be listed individually as specific line items on an account 
statement, they can have a substantial impact on an invest -
ment over time.Fees and expenses vary from fund to fund.If the funds are 
otherwise the same, a fund with lower fees will outperform a fund with higher fees.Remember, the more investors pay 
in fees and expenses, the less money they will have in their 
investment portfolio.As noted above, index funds typically 
have lower fees than actively man aged funds.

ETFs don’t charge shareholder fees (that are required to be included in the fee table) directly to investors.But, they may have several types of transaction fees and costs which are also descr ibed below.Fee Table: Shareholder Fees  for mutual funds 
(fees paid directly from an investment)
■■Sales Charge (Load) on Purchases—a fee some mutual 
funds charge investors when they buy shares, also known as a front-end load .This fee is typically paid to the broker that sells 
the mutual fund’s shares.In this respect, a sales load is like a commission investors pay when they purchase any type of security (like a stock or an ETF) from a broker.Front-end loads reduce the amount of an investment.For example, let’s say an investor has $1,000 and wants to invest it in a mutual fund with a 5% front-end load.The $50 sales load the investor must pay comes off the top of the investment leaving the remaining $950 to be invested in the mutual fund.■■Purchase Fee—a fee some mutual funds charge investors 
when they buy shares.Unlike a front-end sales load, a pur -
chase fee is paid into fund assets (not to a broker) and is typi -
cally imposed to defray some of the mutual fund’s costs associ -
ated with the purchase.This fee is often imposed by a mutual fund that has high transaction costs, for example, because of its investment strategy.

Like front-end sales loads, purchase fees reduce the amount of the investment.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 27■■Deferred Sales Charge (Load) —a fee some mutual funds 
charge investors when they sell or redeem their shares, also 
known as a back-end load .This fee is typically paid to the 
broker that sells the mutual fund’s shares.The most common type of back-end sales load is the contingent deferred sales 
load (also known as the CDSC or CDSL).The amount of this type of sales load will depend on how long the investor holds 
his or her shares.It typically decreases to zero if the investor 
holds his or her shares for a specified time period.When an 
investor purchases shares that are subject to a back-end sales 
load rather than a front-end sales load, no sales load is deduct -
ed at purchase, and all of the investors’ money is immediately 
used to purchase fund shares (assuming that no other fees or 
charges apply at the time of purchase).However, a back-end 
sales load will reduce an investor’s return on the investment.Typically, a fund calculates the amount of a back-end sales 
load based on the lesser of the value of the investor’s initial 
investment or the value of the investment at redemption.■■Redemption Fee —a fee some mutual funds charge inves -
tors when they sell or redeem their shares within a certain time frame of purchasing the shares.Unlike a deferred sales 
load, a redemption fee is paid into fund assets (not to the  
broker) and is typically used to defray fund costs associated with an investor’s redemption.

■■Exchange Fee—a fee some mutual funds charge investors 
when they exchange (transfer) their investment to another 
fund within the same fund group or family of funds.28 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFS■■Account Fee—a fee some mutual funds charge investors 
in connection with the maintenance of their accounts.For 
example, some funds impose an account maintenance fee on accounts whose value is less than a certain dollar amount.Transaction fees and costs for  
ETFs	not	reflected	in	the	Fee	Table	
■■Brokerage Commissions —ETF investors typically pay their 
brokers sales commissions with each purchase or sale of ETF shares, although some ETFs may be available commission-free.In this respect, a commission is like a sales load investors pay when purchasing or redeeming a mutual fund.Like front-end sales loads, brokerage commissions on a purchase reduce the amount of the investment.Like back-end sales loads, broker -
age commissions on a sale reduce an investor’s return on the investment.A brokerage commission may be structured as a flat fee charged every time an investor trades.With a flat fee, the smaller the amount traded, the larger the percentage cost per trade is.Investors should consider the fee structure of a commission when purchasing or selling ETF shares.Check with your broker regarding these fees.

■■Bid-ask spread —ETFs and other securities that trade on 
a securities market actually have two market prices—the bid price and the ask price.The term bid refers to the highest price a buyer will pay to buy a specified number of ETF shares at any given time.The term ask refers to the lowest price at which a seller will sell the ETF shares.The bid price will be lower thanU.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 29the ask price and the difference between two prices is called 
the spread.An example is an ETF share that is trading for 
$59.50/$60.The bid price is $59.50, the ask price is $60.00,  
and the spread is 50 cents.If an investor buys 200 ETF shares at the ask price of $60 and sells them immediately at the bid 
price of $59.50, the investor would incur a loss of $100.This 
example demonstrates the impact of the spread on an ETF 
investment.ETFs that are more liquid and have higher trading 
volume have tighter or smaller spreads.The spread can be 
thought of as a hidden cost to investors since spreads reduce 
potential returns.

This is a potential cost but also a potential gain.An ETF share  
is trading at a premium when its market price is higher than the NAV or the value of its underlying holdings.An ETF share  
is trading at a discount when its market price is lower than  
the NAV or value of its underlying holdings.An investor may,  
therefore, pay more or less than the NAV when buying shares or receive more or less than NAV when selling shares.30 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSA Word about Exchanging Shares
A family of funds is a group of mutual funds that 
share administrative and distribution systems.Each fund in a family may have different investment objec -
tives and follow different strategies.Some funds offer exchange privileges within a 
family of funds, allowing shareholders to directly transfer their holdings from one fund to another as their investment goals or tolerance for risk change.While some funds impose fees for exchanges, most funds typically do not.To learn more about a fund’s exchange policies, call the fund’s toll-free number, visit its website, or read the “Shareholder Information” section of the prospectus.Bear in mind that exchanges have tax conse-
quences.Even if the fund doesn’t charge for the transfer, the investor will be liable for any capital gain on the sale of the old shares or, depending on the circumstances, eligible to take a capital loss (taxes are discussed generally on pages 36-37).

They can also include any other man -
agement fees payable to the fund’s investment adviser or its 
affiliates and administrative fees payable to the investment 
adviser that are not included in the Other Expenses category 
(discussed below).■■Distribution [and/or Service] (12b-1) Fees —fees paid out 
of mutual fund or ETF assets to cover the costs of distribution (e.g., marketing and selling fund shares) and sometimes to 
cover the costs of providing shareholder services.Distribution 
Fees include fees to compensate brokers and others who sell fund shares and to pay for advertising, the printing and mailing 
of prospectuses to new investors, and the printing and mailing 
of sales literature.Shareholder Service Fees are fees paid to 
persons to respond to investor inquiries and provide investors 
with information about their investments.Shareholder service 
fees can be paid outside of 12b-1 fees, and if they are, they are 
included in the Other Expenses category (discussed below).■■Other Expenses—fees paid out of mutual fund or ETF 
assets that are not already included under Management Fees 
or Distribution or Service (12b-1) Fees (such as any sharehold -
er service expenses that are not already included in the 12b-1 fees), custodial expenses, legal and account expenses, transfer 
agent expenses and other administrative expenses.32 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFS■■Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (Expense  
Ratio)—the line of the fee table that represents the total of 
a mutual fund’s or ETF’s annual fund operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of the fund’s average net assets.Looking at the expense ratio can help investors make compari -
sons among various mutual funds and ETFs.Investors should be sure to review carefully the fee tables 
of any mutual funds or ETFs they’re considering, including no-load mutual funds.Even small differences i n fees can  
translate into large differences in returns over  time.For  
example, if an investor invested $10,000 in a  fund that  
produced a 5% annual return before expens es and had  
annual operating expenses of 1.5%, then after 20 years the investor could have roughly $19,612.

A Word about No-Load Mutual Funds
Some mutual funds call themselves no-load.As the 
name implies, this means that the mutual fund does not charge any type of sales load.But, as discussed above, not every type of shareholder fee is a sales load.A no-load fund may charge direct fees that are not sales loads, such as purchase fees, redemption fees, exchange fees, and account fees.No-load funds also will have annual fund operating expenses that investors pay for indirectly through fund assets.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 33Classes of Mutual Funds 
Although ETFs offer only one class of shares, many mutual 
funds offer more than one class of shares.Each class will 
invest in the same portfolio of securities and will have the 
same investment objectives and policies.But each class 
will have different shareholder services and/or distribution arrangements with different fees and expenses.Because of 
the different fees and expenses, each class will likely have 
different performance results.A multi-class structure offers 
investors the ability to select a fee and expense structure that 
is most appropriate for their investment goals (including the 
time that they expect to remain invested in the fund).Here are 
some key characteristics of the most common mutual fund 
share classes offered to individual  investors:
■■Class A Shares—Class A shares typically charge a front-end 
sales load, but they tend to have a lower 12b-1 fee and lower annual expenses than other mutual fund share classes.

What are you paying yourself every month?Many people get into the habit of saving and investing by following this advice: always pay yourself or your family first.Many people find it easier to pay themselves first if they allow their bank to automatically re -
move money from their paycheck and deposit it into a savings or investment account.Likely even better, for tax purposes, is to participate in an 
employer-sponsored retirement plan such as a 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b).These plans will typically not only automatically de -
duct money from your paycheck, but will immediately reduce the taxes you are paying.Additionally, in many plans the em -
ployer matches some or all of your contribution.When your employer does that, it’s offering “free money.” 
Any time you have automatic deductions made from your 
paycheck or bank account, you’ll increase the chances of being able to stick to your plan and to realize your goals.A ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY   |  7FINDING MONEY TO SAVE OR INVEST 
If you are spending all your income, and never have money to 
save or invest, you’ll need to look for ways to cut back on your 
expenses.When you watch where you spend your money, you 
will be surprised how small everyday expenses that you can do 
without add up over a year.KNOW  YOUR INCOME AND WHAT YOU SPEND

How much does a cup of coffee cost you?

These discounts are called breakpoints 
(discussed below).■■Class B Shares—Class B shares typically do not have a front-
end sales load.Instead, they may charge a contingent deferred 
sales load and a 12b-1 fee (along with other annual expenses).Typically the amount of the contingent deferred sales load de -
creases the longer an investor holds the shares.Class B shares also might convert automatically to a class with a lower 12b-1 
fee and no contingent deferred sales load if the investor holds 
the shares long enough.34 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFS■■Class C Shares—Class C shares might have a 12b-1 fee, oth -
er annual expenses, and either a front-end or back-end sales 
load.But the front-end or back-end load for Class C shares 
tends to be lower than for Class A or Class B shares, respec -
tively.Unlike Class B shares, Class C shares generally do not convert to another class; as a result, the back-end load will not 
decrease over time.Class C shares tend to have higher annual 
expenses than either Class A or Class B shares.■■Other Classes—Other classes may also exist for some funds.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 35A Word about Breakpoints
Some mutual funds that charge front-end sales 
loads will charge lower sales loads for larger invest-ments.

The SEC does not require a mutual fund to offer 
breakpoints in its sales load.But, if the mutual fund offers breakpoints, the mutual fund must disclose them and brokers must apply them.In addition, a brokerage firm is not allowed to sell shares of a mutual fund in an amount that is just below the mutual fund’s breakpoint simply to earn a higher commission.Each fund company establishes its own formula 
for how it will calculate whether an investor is entitled to receive a breakpoint.For that reason, it is important for investors to seek out breakpoint infor -
mation from their financial advisors or the mutual fund itself.An investor will need to ask how a par-ticular mutual fund establishes eligibility for break-point discounts, as well as what the mutual fund’s breakpoint amounts are.Some of this information is also included in the “Fee Table” section of the mutual fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus.36 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSTax Consequences
When an investor buys and holds an individual stock or bond, 
the investor must pay income tax each year on the dividends 
or interest received.But the investor won’t have to pay any 
capital gains tax until he or she actually sells and unless he 
or she makes a profit.Mutual funds and ETFs are somewhat 
different.As with an individual stock, when an investor buys and 
holds mutual fund or ETF shares the investor will owe income 
tax each year on any dividends received.

However, unlike with an individual stock, an investor may 
also have to pay taxes each year on the mutual fund’s or ETF’s capital gains  even if the mutual fund or ETF has had a negative 
return and the investor hasn’t sold any shares.That’s because the law requires mutual funds and ETFs to distribute any net 
capital gains on the sale of portfolio securities to shareholders.ETFs are typically more tax efficient in this regard than mutual 
funds because ETF shares are frequently redeemed in-kind 
by the Authorized Participants.This means that an ETF may 
deliver specified portfolio securities to Authorized Participants 
who are redeeming creation units instead of selling portfolio 
securities to meet redemption demands.The selling of port -
folio securities could otherwise result in taxable capital gains 
to the ETF that would typically be passed through to the retail 
investor.Nevertheless, the tax efficiency of ETFs is not relevant 
if an investor holds the mutual fund or ETF investment in a 
tax-advantaged account, such as an IRA o r a 401(k).SEC rules require mutual funds and ETFs to disclose in their 
prospectuses after-tax returns.In calculating after-tax returns, 
mutual funds and ETFs must use standardized formulasU.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 37similar to the ones used to calculate before-tax average annual 
total returns.A fund’s after-tax returns are discussed in the “Investments, Risks and Performance” section of the prospec -
tus.When comparing mutual funds and/or ETFs, be sure to take taxes into account.

The investor will, however, owe taxes on any capital gains.Sources of Information
■■Prospectus and Summary Prospectus
Mutual funds must provide a copy of the fund’s prospectus to shareholders after they purchase shares, but investors can—and should—request and read the mutual fund’s prospectus before making an investment decision.There are two kinds of prospectuses: (1) the statutory prospectus; and (2) the sum -
mary prospectus.The statutory prospectus is the traditional, long-form prospectus with which most mutual fund investors are familiar.The summary prospectus, which is used by many mutual funds, is just a few pages long and contains key infor -
mation about a mutual fund.The SEC specifies the kinds of information that must be included in mutual fund prospec -
tuses and requires mutual funds to present the information in a standard format so that investors can readily compare different mutual funds.38 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSThe same key information required in the summary pro -
spectus is required to be in the beginning of the statutory 
prospectus.It appears in the following standardiz ed order:   
(1) investment objectives/goals; (2) fee table; (3) investments, risks, and performance; (4) management—investment advisers 
and portfolio managers; (5) purchase and sale of fund shares; 
(6) tax information; and (7) financial intermediary compensa -
tion.Investors can also find more detailed information in the statutory prospectus, including financial highlights i nformation.An ETF will also have a prospectus, and some ETFs may 
have a summary prospectus, both of which are subject to the 
same legal requirements as mutual fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses.All investors who purchase creation 
units (i.e., Authorized Participants) receive a prospectus.

All ETFs are required to deliver a prospectus upon 
request and without charge, and the prospectus will usually be 
available on the ETF ’s website.While they may seem daunting at first, mutual fund and 
ETF prospectuses contain valuable information.Here’s some of 
what is included in mutual fund and ETF pr ospectuses:
• Investment Objective—The prospectus will  
describe the mutual fund’s or ETF’s investment 
objectives or goals.A fund may also identify its type 
or category (e.g., that it is a money market fund or 
balanced fund).• Fee Table—This table describes the mutual fund’s 
or ETF’s fees and expenses, which include the share -
holder fees and annual fund operating expenses (discussed on pages 26-32).The fee table includesU.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 39an example that will help investors compare costs 
among different mutual funds or ETFs by showing 
them the costs associated with investing a hypotheti -
cal $10,000 over a 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year period.• Key Risks—The prospectus will discuss the mutual 
fund’s or ETF’s principal investment risks.• Financial Highlights Information —This section, 
which generally appears towards the back of the 
prospectus, contains audited data concerning the 
mutual fund’s or ETF’s financial performance for each 
of the past 5 years.Here an investor will find net 
asset values (for both the beginning and end of each 
period), total returns, and various ratios, including 
the ratio of expenses to average net assets, the ratio 
of net income to average net assets, and the portfo -
lio turnover rate.■■Statement of Additional Information (SAI)
The SAI explains a mutual fund’s or ETF’s operations in greater detail than the prospectus—including the mutual fund’s or 
ETF’s financial statements and details about the history of 
the mutual fund or ETF, its policies on borrowing and con -
centration, the identity of officers, directors and persons who control the mutual fund or ETF, investment advisory and other 
services, brokerage commissions paid on portfolio securities 
transactions, tax matters, and performance such as yield and 
average annual total return information.

The back cover of 
the mutual fund’s or ETF’s prospectus should contain informa -
tion on how to obta in the SAI.40 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFS■■Shareholder Reports 
A mutual fund also must provide shareholders with annual 
and semi-annual reports within 60 days after the end of the fund’s fiscal year and 60 days after the fund’s fiscal mid-year.These reports contain updated financial information, a list of the fund’s portfolio securities, and other information.The information in the shareholder reports will be current as of the date of the report (that is, the last day of the fund’s fiscal year for the annual report, and the last day of the fund’s fiscal mid-year for the semi-annual report).Investors can obtain all of these do cuments by:
• Visiting the mutual fund’s or ETF’s website;
• Calling or writing to the mutual fund or ETF (all mutu -
al funds and ETFs have toll-free telephone numbers);
• Contacting a broker that sells the mutual fund’s or ETF’s shares;
• Searching the SEC’s EDGAR database ( www.sec.gov/
edgar/searchedgar/mutualsearch.html ) and down -
loading the documents for free; or
• Contacting the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy by telephone (800) 732-0330.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 41Avoiding Common Pitfalls 
Past Performance 
A mutual fund’s or ETF’s past performance is not as important 
as one might think.Advertisements, rankings, and ratings 
often emphasize how well a mutual fund or ETF has per -
formed in the past.But studies show that the future is often different.This year’s number one mutual fund or ETF can 
easily become next year’s below average mutual f und or ETF.For mutual funds and ETFs, be sure to find out how long 
the fund has been in existence.Newly created or small mutual 
funds or ETFs sometimes have excellent short-term perfor -
mance records.

But as these mutual funds and ETFs grow larger and increase the 
number of stocks they own, each stock has less impact on 
performance.This may make it more difficult to sustain ini -
tial results.While past performance does not necessarily predict 
future returns, it can tell an investor how volatile (or stable) a 
mutual fund or ETF has been over a period of time.Generally, 
the more volatile a fund, the higher the investment risk.If you 
will need your money to meet a financial goal in the near-term, 
you probably can’t afford the risk of investing in a fund with a 
volatile history because you will not have enough time to ride out any declines in the st ock market.For index mutual funds and index ETFs, remember that 
these funds are designed to track a particular market index 
and their past performance is related to how well that market 
index did.42 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSLooking Beyond A Mutual Fund or ETF Name 
Don’t assume that a mutual fund called the “ZYX Stock Fund” 
invests only in stocks or that the “Martian High-Yield Fund” 
invests only in the securities of companies headquartered on the planet Mars.The SEC generally requires that any mutual fund or ETF with a name suggesting that it focuses on a partic -
ular type of investment must invest at least 80% of its assets in the type of investment suggested by its name.But mutual funds and ETFs can still invest up to one-fifth of their holdings in other types of securities—including securities that a partic -
ular investor might consider too risky or perhaps not aggres -
sive enough.Bank Products Versus Mutual Funds 
Many banks now sell mutual funds, some of which carry the bank’s name.But mutual funds sold in banks, including money market funds, are not bank deposits.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 43Money Market Matters
Don’t confuse a money market fund with a money 
market deposit account.The names are similar, but they are completely different.A money market fund is a type of mutual fund.It is not guaranteed or FDIC-insured.When an investor buys shares in a money market fund, he or she should receive a prospectus.A money market deposit account is a bank deposit.It is guaranteed and FDIC-insured.When a saver 
deposits money in a money market deposit account, he or she should receive a Truth in Savings form.44 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSIf You Have a Question or

ETF Terms  
12b-1 Fees —fees paid out of mutual fund or ETF assets to 
cover the costs of marketing and selling mutual fund shares 
and sometimes to cover the costs of providing shareholder services.

Shareholder Service Fees are fees paid to persons to respond to investor inquiries and provide investors with information about their investments.Account Fee—a fee that some mutual funds separately  
charge investors for the maintenance of their accounts.For example, accounts below a specified dollar amount may have to pay an a ccount fee.Authorized Participants —financial institutions,  which are  
typically large broker-dealers, who enter into contractual relationships with ETFs to buy and redeem creation units of ETF shares.Back-end Load —a sales charge (also known as a deferred 
sales charge) investors pay when they redeem (or sell) mutual 
fund shares; generally used by the mutual fund to compen -
sate brokers.46 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSBrokers—an individual who acts as an intermediary between 
a buyer and seller, usually charging a commission to exe -
cute trades.Brokerage Commissions —A fee investors pay their brokers 
with each purchase or sale of ET F shares.Classes—different types of shares issued by a single mutual 
fund, often referred to as Class A shares, Class B shares, and so 
on.Each class invests in the same pool (or investment portfo -
lio) of securities and has the same investment objectives and 
policies.But each class has different shareholder services and/or distribution arrangements with different fees and expenses 
and therefore different performan ce results.Closed-End Fund—a type of investment company that does 
not continuously offer its shares for sale but instead sells a 
fixed number of shares at one time (in the initial public offer -
ing) which then typically trade on a secondary market, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market—
legally known as a closed-end investment company.

For example, a contin -
gent deferred sales load might be (X)% if an investor holds his 
or her shares for one year, (X-1)% after two years, and so on 
until the load reaches zero and goes away completely.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 47Conversion —a feature some mutual funds offer that allows 
investors to automatically change from one class to another 
(typically with lower annual expenses) after a set period of 
time.The mutual fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus 
will state whether a class ever converts to another class.Creation Units —large blocks of shares of an ETF, typically 
50,000 shares or more, usually sold in in-kind exchanges to 
Authorized Participants.Deferred Sales Charge —see back-end load (above).Discount to NAV —when an ETF’s market price is trading 
lower than the value of the underlying holdings.Distribution Fees —fees paid out of mutual fund or ETF assets 
to cover expenses for marketing and selling mutual fund or 
ETF shares, including advertising costs, compensation for bro -
kers and others who sell mutual fund shares, and payments for printing and mailing prospectuses to new investors and 
sales literature prospective investors—sometimes referred to 
as 12b-1 fees.Exchange Fee—a fee that some mutual funds charge share -
holders if they exchange (transfer) to another mutual fund 
within the same fund group.48 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSExchange-Traded Funds—a type of an investment company 
(either an open-end company or UIT) that differs from tradi -
tional mutual funds, because shares issued by ETFs trade on a secondary market and are only redeemable by Authorized Participants from the fund itself in very large blocks (blocks of 50,000 shares for example) called crea tion units.Expense Ratio—a mutual fund’s or ETF’s total annual operat -
ing expenses (including management fees, distribution (12b-1) fees, and other expenses) expressed as a percentage of aver -
age net assets.Front-end Load—an upfront sales charge investors pay when they purchase mutual fund shares, generally used by the mutual fund to compensate brokers.

Index Fund or ETF—describes a type of mutual fund or ETF whose investment objective typically is to achieve the same return as a particular market index, such as the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index, the Russell 2000 Index, or the Wilshire 5000 Total Ma rket Index.Investment Adviser—generally, a person or entity who receives compensation for giving individually tailored advice to a specific person on investing in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.Some investment advisers also manage portfolios of securities, including mutual funds.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 49Investment Company—a company (corporation, business 
trust, partnership, or limited liability company) that issues 
securities and is primarily engaged in the business of investing 
in securities.The three basic types of investment companies 
are open-end funds (mutual funds and most ETFs), closed-end 
funds, and unit investment trusts (some ETFs).Load—see Sales Charge.Management Fee —fee paid out of mutual fund or ETF assets 
to the fund’s investment adviser or its affiliates for managing 
the fund’s portfolio, any other management fee payable to the fund’s investment adviser or its affiliates, and any admin -
istrative fee payable to the investment adviser that are not included in the “Other Expenses” category.A fund’s manage -
ment fee appears as a category under “Annual Fund Operating Expenses” in the Fee Table.Market Index—a measurement of the performance of a 
specific basket of stocks or bonds considered to represent 
a particular market or sector of the U.S. stock market or the 
economy.For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) 
is an index of 30 blue chip U.S. stocks of industrial companies (excluding transportation and utility companies).Mutual Fund—the common name for an open-end invest -
ment company.Like other types of investment companies, 
mutual funds pool money from many investors and invest 
the money in stocks, bonds, short-term money-market instru -
ments, or other securities.

50 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSthrough a broker for the fund) instead of purchasing from 
investors on a second ary market.NAV (Net Asset Value) —the per-share value of the mutual 
fund’s or ETF’s assets minus its liabilities.SEC rules require mutual funds and ETFs to calculate the NAV at least once daily.To calculate the NAV per share, a fund subtracts the fund’s
 
liabilities from its assets and then divides the result by the number of shares o utstanding.No-load Fund—a mutual fund that does not charge any type of sales load.But not every type of shareholder fee is a sales load, and a no-load fund may charge fees that are not sales loads.No-load funds also charge operating expenses.Open-End Company—the legal name for a mutual fund 
and most ETFs.An open-end company is a type of invest -
ment company.Operating Expenses—the costs a mutual fund or ETF incurs 
in connection with running the fund, including management fees, distribution (12b-1) fees, and other expenses.Portfolio —an individual’s or entity’s combined holdings of 
stocks, bonds, or other securities and assets.

Prospectus—disclosure document that describes the mutual fund or ETF.Each mutual fund or ETF has a prospectus.TheU.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 51prospectus contains information about the fund’s costs, 
investment objectives, risks, and performance.You can get a prospectus from the mutual fund company or ETF sponsor (through its website or by phone or mail).Your financial pro -
fessional or broker can also provide you w ith a copy.Purchase Fee—a shareholder fee that some mutual funds charge when investors purchase mutual fund shares.Not the same as (and may be in addition to) a fron t-end load.Redemption Fee —a shareholder fee that some mutual 
funds charge when investors redeem (or sell) mutual fund  
shares within a certain time frame of purchasing the shares.Redemption fees (which must be paid to the fund) are not the same as (and may be in addition to) a back-end load (which is typically paid to a broker).The SEC generally limits redemption fees to 2%.

Secondary Market—markets where existing securities are 
bough t and sold.Shareholder Fees—fees charged directly to investors in connection with particular investor transactions such as
 
buying, selling, or exchanging shares or periodically with respect to account fees including sales loads, purchase or redemption fees.52 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSShareholder Service Fees —fees paid out of mutual fund or 
ETF assets to persons to respond to investor inquiries and 
provide investors with information about their in vestments.See also 12b-1 fees.Statement of Additional Information (SAI)—disclosure 
document that provides information about a mutual fund or ETF in addition to, and sometimes in more detail, than the prospectus.Although mutual funds and ETFs are not required to provide investors with the SAI, they must give investors the SAI upon request and with out charge.Summary Prospectus—a disclosure document that summa -
rizes key information for mutual fund s and ETFs.Total Annual Fund Operating Expense—the total of a mutual fund’s or ETF’s annual fund operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of the fund’s average net assets.The total annual fund operating expenses is included in the fund’s fee table in the prospectus.Unit Investment Trust (UIT)—a type of investment company that typically makes a one-time public offering of only a spe -

 It’s easy to forget how much you’ve charged on your credit 
card.Every time you use a credit card, write down how much 
you have spent and figure out how much you’ll have to pay that 
month.

Pay Off the Card with the Highest Rate
 If you’ve got unpaid balances on several credit cards, you should 
first pay down the card that charges the highest rate.Pay as much 
as you can toward that debt each month until your balance is once 
again zero, while still paying the minimum on your other cards.The same advice goes for any other high interest debt (about 8% or 
above) which does not offer the tax advantages of, for example, a mortgage.Now, once you have paid off those credit cards and begun to 
set aside some money to save and invest, what are your choices?10  |  SAVING AND INVESTINGMaking Money Grow
