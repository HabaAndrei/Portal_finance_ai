Raspuns:  The firm has the authority to 
immediately sell any security in your account, without notice 
to you, to cover any shortfall resulting from a decline in the 
value of your securities.Y ou may owe a substantial amount of 
money even after your securities are sold.The margin account 
agreement generally provides that the securities in your mar -
gin account may be lent out by the brokerage firm at any time 
without notice or compensation to you.3.How much risk should you assume?In a new account agreement, you must specify your overall 
investment objective in terms of risk.Categories of risk may 
have labels such as “income,” “growth,” or “aggressive growth.” 
Be certain that you fully understand the distinctions among 
these terms, and be certain that the risk level you choose ac -

the category of risk you have selected.When opening a new account, the brokerage firm may ask 
you to sign a legally binding contract to use the arbitration 
process to settle any future dispute between you and the firm 
or your sales representative.Signing this agreement means that 
you give up the right to sue your sales representative and firm 
in court.A ROADMAP TO YOUR JOURNEY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY   |  23How Can I Protect Myself?

Raspuns:  They generally have higher risks than money market funds (discussed on pages 18-19), largely because14 |  MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFSthey typically pursue strategies aimed at producing higher 
yields.Unlike money market funds, the SEC’s rules do not restrict bond funds to high-quality or short-term investments.Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically in their risks an d rewards.Some of the risks associated with bond fund s include: 
• Credit Risk—the possibility that companies or other issuers whose bonds are owned by the fund may fail to pay their debts (including the debt owed to holders of their bonds).Credit risk is less of a factor for bond funds that invest in insured bonds or U.S. Treasury Bonds.By contrast, those that invest in the bonds of companies with poor credit ratings generally will be subject to higher risk; 
• Interest Rate Risk—the risk that the market value of the bonds will go down when interest rates go up.Because of this, an investor can lose money in any bond fund, including those that invest only in insured bonds or U.S. Treasury Bonds.Funds that invest in longer-term bonds tend to have higher interest rate  risk; and,
• Prepayment Risk—the chance that a bond will be paid off early.For example, if interest rates fall, a bond issuer may decide to pay off (or retire) its debt and issue new bonds that pay a lower rate.When this happens, the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds in an investment with as high a return or yield.

Raspuns:  Investors 
should be aware that the performance of these ETFs over a 
period longer than one day will probably differ significantly 
from their stated daily performance objectives.These ETFs 
often employ techniques such as engaging in short sales and 
using swaps, futures contracts and other derivatives that can 
expose the ETF, and by extension the ETF investors, to a host of risks.As such, these are specialized products that typically are 
not 
suitable for buy-and-hold investors.U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION   | 21A Word on Active and Passive Investing
An active investment strategy relies on the skill of an 
investment manager to construct and manage the port -
folio of a fund in an effort to provide exposure to certain types of investments or outperform an investment benchmark or index.An actively managed fund has the potential to outperform the market, but its perfor -
mance is dependent on the skill of the manager.Also, actively managed funds historically have had higher management fees, which can significantly lower invest -
ment returns.The shareholder is paying for more active management of portfolio assets, which often leads to higher turnover costs in the portfolio and potentially negative federal income tax consequences.Passive investing is an investment strategy that is 
designed to achieve approximately the same return as a particular market index, before fees.The strategy can be implemented by replication—purchasing 100% of the securities in the same proportion as in the index or benchmark—or by a representative sampling of stocks in the index.Passive investing also typically comes with lower management fees.As discussed above, passively managed mutual funds are typically called index funds.

Raspuns:  Once you’ve saved money for investing, consider carefully all 
your options and think about what diversification strategy makes 
sense for you.While the SEC cannot recommend any particular 
investment product, you should know that a vast array of invest -
ment products exists—including stocks and stock mutual funds, 
corporate and municipal bonds, bond mutual funds, certificates 
of deposit, money market funds, and U.S. Treasury securities.Diversification can’t guarantee  that your investments won’t 
suffer if the market drops.But it can improve the chances that 
you won’t lose money, or that if you do, it won’t be as much as 
if you weren’t diversified.What are the best investments for me?The answer depends on when you will need the money, 
your goals, and if you will be able to sleep at night if you pur -
chase a risky investment where you could lose your principal.For instance, if you are saving for retirement, and you have 
35 years before you retire, you may want to consider riskier 
investment products, knowing that if you stick to only the “sav -
ings” products or to less risky investment products, your money 
will grow too slowly—or, given inflation and taxes, you may 
lose the purchasing power of your money.A frequent mistake 
people make is putting money they will not need for a very 
long time in investments that pay a low amount of interest.On the other hand, if you are saving for a short-term goal, 
five years or less, you don’t want to choose risky investments, 
because when it’s time to sell, you may have to take a loss.Since 
investments often move up and down in value rapidly, you want 
to make sure that you can wait and sell at the best possible time.14  |  SAVING AND INVESTINGWhat are investments all about?
